# Learn HTML by Building a Photo App

Course designed by Quincy Larson, freeCodeCamp.org

## Step 1 | Set the Heading Element level 1 as the main heading
HTML elements have an opening and closing tag with content in between.

Here is the basic syntax:


<details>
<summary> <h3> Example Code </h3></summary>

```html
<openingTag>content</closingTag>
```
</details>

The first element you will learn about is the `h1` element. The `h1` element is a heading element and is used for the main heading of a webpage.

<details>


```html  
<h1>This is a main heading</h1>
```
</details>

Change the text of the h1 element below from *Hello World* to *CatPhotoApp* and watch the change in the browser preview.

When you are done, press the **Check Your Code** button to see if it's correct.


## Step 2 | Add an Heading Element level 2 as a subheading
The `h1` through `h6` heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so `h2` elements have less importance than `h1` elements.

<details>
<summary><h3>Example Code </h3></summary>

```html
<h1>most important heading element</h1>
<h2>second most important heading element</h2>
<h3>third most important heading element</h3>
<h4>fourth most important heading element</h4>
<h5>fifth most important heading element</h5>
<h6>least important heading element</h6>
```
</details>

Only use one `h1` element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.

Below the `h1` element, add an `h2 `element with this text :  Perky Photos


## Step 3 | Add a Paragraph Element
The `p `element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites. Create a `p` element below your `h2` element and give it the following text, See more motiviting photos in the gallery.

## Step 4 | Add a Comment in HTML
Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. A comment in HTML starts with `<!--`, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with `-->`.

Here is an example of a comment with the `TODO: Remove h1`:

<details>
<summary> <h3> Example Code </h3></summary>

```html
<!-- TODO: Remove h1 -->
 ```

</details>

Add a comment above the p element with this text:

`TODO: Add link to photos`

## Step 5 | Add a Main Element
HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

The `main` element is used to represent the main content of the body of an HTML document. Content inside the `main` element should be unique to the document and should not be repeated in other parts of the document.

<details>
<summary> <h3> Example Code </h3></summary>

```html
<main>
  <h1>Most important content of the document</h1>
  <p>Some more important content...</p>
</main>
```
</details>

Identify the main section of this page by adding a `<main>` opening tag before the `h1` element, and a `</main>` closing tag after the `p` element.


## Step 6 | Nest Elements and indent
In the previous step, you put the `h1`,`h2`, *comment*, and `p` elements inside the main element. This is called *nesting*. Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element they are nested in. This spacing is called *indentation* and it is used to make HTML easier to read.

Here is an example of *nesting* and *indentation*:

<details>
<summary> <h3> Example Code </h3></summary>

```html
<main>
  <h1>Most important content of the document</h1>
  <p>Some more important content...</p>
</main>
```
</details>
The `h1` element, `h2` element and the *comment* are indented two spaces more than the main element in the code below. Use the space bar on your keyboard to add two more spaces in front of the `p` element so that it is indented properly as well.

## Step 7 | Add an Image to the Webapp
You can add images to your website by using the `img` element. `img` elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a self-closing tag.

Add an `img` element below the `p` element. At this point, no image will show up in the browser.

## Step 8 | Add a URL to the Image Source
HTML *attributes* are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. The `src` *attribute* in an `img `element specifies the image's *URL* (where the image is located).

Here is an example of an img element with a src attribute pointing to the freeCodeCamp logo:

<details>
<summary> <h3> Example Code </h3></summary>

```html
<img src=img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_secondary.svg" >
```
</details>

Inside the existing img element, add a src attribute with this URL: 
https://bluesmileyfaces.netlify.app/bluesmileyfaces.png

## Step 9 | Add an Alt Attribute to the Image
All `img` elements should have an `alt` attribute. The `alt` attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

Here is an example of an `img` element with an `alt` attribute:

<details>
<summary> <h3> Example Code </h3></summary>

```html
<img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat">
```
</details>

Inside the `img` element, add an `alt` attribute with this text:
A cute orange cat lying on its back


## Step 10 | Create a Hyperlink
You can link to another page with the anchor `a` element.

Here is an example linking to https://www.freecodecamp.org:

<details>
<summary> <h3> Example Code </h3></summary>

```html
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org"></a>
```
</details>

Add an anchor element after the paragraph that links to https://freecatphotoapp.com. At this point, the link wonâ€™t show up in the preview.


## Step 11 | Add Link Text to a Hyperlink
A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of an anchor `a` element.

Here is an example of a link with the text click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org:

<details>
<summary> <h3> Example Code </h3></summary>

```html
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org</a>
```

Add the anchor text link to cat pictures to the anchor element. This will become the link's text.
</details>


## Step 12 | Add a link to the gallery
You can turn any text into a link, such as the text inside of a `p` element.


<details>
<summary> <h3> Example Code </h3></summary>

```html
<p>I think <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a> is great.</p>

```
</details>
In the text of your p element, turn the words cat photos into a link by adding opening and closing anchor `a `tags around these words. Then set the href attribute to https://freecatphotoapp.com

## Step 13 | Remove the Second Link
Now that you turned the text cat photos inside the `p `element into a link, you don't need the second link below the p element. Delete the entire anchor element below the p element.


## Step 14 | Add target attribute to open links in a new tab
To open links in a new tab, you can use the target attribute on the anchor `a` element.

The `target` attribute specifies where to open the linked document.`target="_blank"` opens the linked document in a new tab or window.

Here is the basic syntax for an a element with a target attribute:


<details>
<summary> <h3> Example Code </h3></summary>

```html
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>

```
</details>

Add a target attribute with the value `_blank` to the anchor `a` element's opening tag, so that the link opens in a new tab.
