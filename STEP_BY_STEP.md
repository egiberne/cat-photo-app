## Step 1 | Set the Heading Element level 1 as the main heading
HTML elements have an opening and closing tag with content in between.

Here is the basic syntax:



<details>
<summary> <h3> Example Code </h3></summary>

```html
<openingTag>content</closingTag>
```
</details>

The first element you will learn about is the `h1` element. The `h1` element is a heading element and is used for the main heading of a webpage.

<details>
<summary>Example Code</summary>

```html  
<h1>This is a main heading</h1>
```
</details>

Change the text of the h1 element below from *Hello World* to *CatPhotoApp* and watch the change in the browser preview.

When you are done, press the **Check Your Code** button to see if it's correct.


## Step 2 | Add an Heading Element level 2 as a subheading
The `h1` through `h6` heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so `h2` elements have less importance than `h1` elements.

<details>
<summary><h3>Example Code </h3></summary>

```html
<h1>most important heading element</h1>
<h2>second most important heading element</h2>
<h3>third most important heading element</h3>
<h4>fourth most important heading element</h4>
<h5>fifth most important heading element</h5>
<h6>least important heading element</h6>
```
</details>

Only use one `h1` element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.

Below the `h1` element, add an `h2 `element with this text :  Perky Photos


## Step 3 | Add a Paragraph Element
The `p `element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites. Create a `p` element below your `h2` element and give it the following text, See more motiviting photos in the gallery.
